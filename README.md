Javascript DOM Manipulation

Page can be accessed at: https://cleargoaldigital.github.io/counter/

This counter was written as a test of my understanding of DOM and Event at the most basic level.

In it, there a couple of things to focus on:

** How to use event listener
** How to create and insert functions in event listener.
** How to use *forEach* loop, and
** How to apply *querySelectorAll*.
